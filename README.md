Oblique Strategies is a simple creative tool inspired by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's cards of the same name.

The Eno and Schmidt deck was used by artists to remove creative blocks. Artists would select a card at random and reveal a cryptic directive like "Try faking it!" or "Ask your body". These directives could take their work in a different direction, or free up a blocked effort.

The strategies I wrote here are intended for the same purpose. Since my own creative practice is more easily moved by images, directive language is sparse in this iteration of Oblique Strategies.
